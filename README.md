This project enhances the review filtering functionality in the Abercrombie & Fitch iOS app by adding a height filter. Previously, users could only filter reviews by weight and rating, even though height was a metric collected when reviews were submitted. The new height filtering feature allows users to more precisely refine reviews based on **all** relevant body measurements. It also puts the collected height metric to practical use, which is likely already being stored in a backend table.
